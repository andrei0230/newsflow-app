# Newsflow
This is a project I started developing to learn Go, http, CRUD and REST.
Newsflow-app is a RESTful Api that manages the database of a newsletter service. It comunicates using http to create, read, update and delete users from a Mysql database.
The end goal is to make a frontend project and implement actual email newsletter functionality.
